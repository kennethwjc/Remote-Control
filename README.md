<h1>🖧 Remote Control</h1>
<h2>📝 Description</h2>
This project automates the process of installing necessary applications, verifying network anonymity, and managing remote server operations. It first ensures required tools are installed, checks for anonymous network connections, and displays the spoofed country name. Users can specify an address for scanning, and the script connects to a remote server via SSH to gather details, perform Whois lookups, and scan for open ports. The results, including Whois and Nmap data, are saved locally, and a log is created to audit the data collection process. This automation streamlines network analysis and remote server management tasks.
